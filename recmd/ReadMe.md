## RECmd Use Cases

### Law Enforcement

For those in Law Enforcement, this tool is useful for parsing Registry hives which can contain a wealth of artifacts that can be attributed to a specific user of interest. There are artifacts within the Windows Registry that can help prove evidence of program execution, evidence of file opening, evidence of user logon, and many more. The Registry is simply too valuable to ignore on almost any possible criminal invesitgation.

### Private Sector

For those in the Private Sector, this tool is useful for parsing Registry hives which can contain possible indicators of threat actor persistence. Additionally, the user-attributable artifacts listed above can be useful when targeting the activity of compromised user accounts.

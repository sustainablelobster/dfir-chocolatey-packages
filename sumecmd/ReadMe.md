# SumECmd Introduction

SumECmd is a tool created by Eric Zimmerman used to parse the SUM database. The SUM database is located at C:\Windows\System32\LogFiles\SUM where multiple *.mdb files can be located.

## SumECmd Use Cases

### Law Enforcement

For those in Law Enforcement, SumECmd may not have an immediate use unless the system(s) being analyzed is attached to a domain. The SUM database can provide authentication history within a Domain, IP resolution within the Domain, and the first and last time an account has been authenticated within a Domain.

### Private Sector

For those in the Private Sector, SumECmd can provide helpful information regarding which compromised accounts have authenticated where and when within a Domain. Additionally, having visibility into the DNS history of a Domain for the current year and previous 2 years is incredibly helpful when trying to figure out which IP address resolved to which host when.

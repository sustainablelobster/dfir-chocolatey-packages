Hindsight is a free tool for analyzing web artifacts. It started with the browsing 
history of the Google Chrome web browser and has expanded to support other Chromium-based 
applications (with more to come!). Hindsight can parse a number of different types of web 
artifacts, including URLs, download history, cache records, bookmarks, autofill records, 
saved passwords, preferences, browser extensions, HTTP cookies, and Local Storage records 
(HTML5 cookies). Once the data is extracted from each file, it is correlated with data 
from other history files and placed in a timeline.

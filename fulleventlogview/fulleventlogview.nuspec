    <description><![CDATA[FullEventLogView is a simple tool for Windows 11/10/8/7/Vista that displays in a table the details of all events
from the event logs of Windows, including the event description. It allows you to view the events of your local 
computer, events of a remote computer on your network, and events stored in .evtx files. It also allows you to 
export the events list to text/csv/tab-delimited/html/xml file from the GUI and from command-line.

## System Requirements

This utility works on any version of Windows, starting from Windows Vista and up to Windows 11. Both 32-bit and
64-bit systems are supported. For Windows XP and older systems, you can use the 
[MyEventViewer](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/my_event_viewer.html) tool.

## SQLECmd Use Cases

### Law Enforcement

For those in Law Enforcement, this tool is useful for parsing SQLite databases which often store common web browser artifacts. SQLECmd can provide as a validation tool to many commonly used forensic suites that parse browsing history, as well. The SQLite queries are available on GitHub and can be modified by the community if ever the database schema evolves enough to where current SQLite queries do not work any longer. Additionally, this tool can be used to parse mobile artifacts which can serve as a validation tool for common mobile forensic suites.

### Private Sector

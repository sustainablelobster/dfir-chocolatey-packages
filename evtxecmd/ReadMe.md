# EvtxECmd Introduction

EvtxECmd is a tool created by Eric Zimmerman used to parse event logs from Windows. Versions of Windows from Vista and beyond have utilized the .evtx format, which incorporates XML payloads within the .evtx files. EvtxECmd only parses .evtx files, so if you're dealing with .evt files, EvtxECmd will not parse those particular files.

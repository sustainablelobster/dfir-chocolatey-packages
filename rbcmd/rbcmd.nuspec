    <description><![CDATA[RBCmd is a tool created by Eric Zimmerman used to parse Windows Recycle Bin artifacts.

## RBCmd Use Cases

### Law Enforcement

For those in Law Enforcement, this tool is useful for parsing Recycle Bin files which can provide indications of what files were deleted when and by which user. This can be crucial for crimes involving contraband multimedia files as key evidence.

### Private Sector

For those in the Private Sector, this tool is useful for parsing Recycle Bin files which can provide indications of what files a threat actor deleted before ending a period of unauthorized access. Often, there will be indicators of threat actor tool output having been deleted by a compromised user account within the Recycle Bin. This can help build out the timeline of events during a period of unauthorized access

# Volatility 3: The volatile memory extraction framework

Volatility is the world's most widely used framework for extracting digital
artifacts from volatile memory (RAM) samples. The extraction techniques are
performed completely independent of the system being investigated but offer
visibility into the runtime state of the system. The framework is intended
to introduce people to the techniques and complexities associated with
extracting digital artifacts from volatile memory samples and provide a
platform for further work into this exciting area of research.

In 2019, the Volatility Foundation released a complete rewrite of the
framework, Volatility 3. The project was intended to address many of the
technical and performance challenges associated with the original
code base that became apparent over the previous 10 years. Another benefit
of the rewrite is that Volatility 3 could be released under a custom
license that was more aligned with the goals of the Volatility community,
the Volatility Software License (VSL). See the 
[LICENSE](https://www.volatilityfoundation.org/license/vsl-v1.0) file for 
more details.

Arsenal-Image-Mounter
=====================

Arsenal Image Mounter mounts the contents of disk images as complete disks in Microsoft Windows. Arsenal Image Mounter includes a virtual SCSI adapter (via a unique Storport miniport driver) which allows users to benefit from disk-specific features in Windows like integration with Disk Manager, access to Volume Shadow Copies, and more. As far as Windows is concerned, the contents of disk images mounted by Arsenal Image Mounter are “real” SCSI disks.
